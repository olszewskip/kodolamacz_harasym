# Username field: Username, up to 8 characters. Case-sensitive, usually all lowercase. A direct match to the username in the /etc/passwd file.
# Password field: Password, 13 character encrypted. A blank entry (eg. ::) indicates a password is not required to log in (usually a bad idea), and a ``*'' entry (eg. :*:) indicates the account has been disabled. This field stores the password in encrypted format:
#
#        $1$ is MD5
#        $2a$ is Blowfish
#        $2y$ is Blowfish
#        $5$ is SHA-256
#        $6$ is SHA-512
#
#        A password field which starts with a exclamation mark means that the password is locked.
#        Both "!" and "!!" being present in the password field mean an account is locked.
#        By default, * is used on accounts where no password has ever been set.
#        By default, !<password_hash> is used when you lock an account.
#        "!!" in an account entry in shadow means the account of an user has been created, but not yet given a password. Until being given an initial password by a sysadmin, it is locked by default.
#
# Last Password Change: The number of days (since January 1, 1970) since the password was last changed.
# Minimum days between password changes: The number of days before password may be changed (0 indicates it may be changed at any time)
# Password validity: The number of days after which password must be changed (99999 indicates user can keep his or her password unchanged for many, many years)
# Warning threshold: The number of days to warn user of an expiring password (7 for a full week)
# Account inactive: The number of days after password expires that account is disabled
# Time since account is disabled: The number of days since January 1, 1970 that an account has been disabled
# A reserved field for possible future use
